text: "The Chance 30-30 is a very solid, stiff boat. She has a deep knuckle at the forefoot which, along with a hefty weight for her size, helps her punch through large seas like a much larger boat. She is very fast to weather, less so (though very well mannered) off the wind. She points very high with speed and LOVES a 30 knot breeze on the nose.

Her accomidations are very traditionally nautical. This is a boat that is meant to be sailed, not turned into a dock condo. This said, my family of four spent over fifty days and nights very comfortably living on her this summer.

She IS built like a tank."
