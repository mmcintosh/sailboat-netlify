text: "She remains the first and only keelboat I've ever owned. I had originally assumed she would be more of a 'starter boat' for me, that I'd eventually move up to something bigger. But the more I sailed her, the more I came to appreciate what a sweet boat she is. And, given the amount of good memories and sweat equity I've put into her by now, I'd have a difficult time ever getting rid of her. I've often thought that if I ever did step up to a bigger boat, I'd want to 'keep her in the family', so to speak - probably by trucking her out to San Francisco or Lake Tahoe, where she could be sailed by my brother and my nephewsâ€¦ "
