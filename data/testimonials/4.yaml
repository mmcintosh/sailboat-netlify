text: "AMAZING BOAT, Perhaps the most surprising 30-foot sailboat ever designed.  The Chance 30 - 30 represents the exceptional thinking of Britton Chance, Jr. one of Americas foremost yacht designers. It incorporates many of the design features that proved successful in Mr. Chance's work on the victorious Americas Cup, Intrepid. Mr. Chance was also on the design team of Stars And Stripes the Americas Cup winner in Australia 1987. The quality of the design is complemented by the fact that the Chance 30-30 was built by the Allied Boat Co. whose hallmark was quality workmanship. There is no better testimonial to a boats seaworthiness and safety. Now that Allied has proven without question the great performance of this boat, it concentrated on producing the finest quality interior found in any boat her size and comparable to the famous Allied interiors found in larger Allied Yachts.
