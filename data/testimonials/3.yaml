text: "The Chance 30-30 was the one and only racing boat built by Allied Boat Company during the 20 years of its existence. Allied turned to one of the greatest racing boat designers of the time, Britton Chance of Hughes Aerospace, to design the boat. In addition to the 30-30, Chance also designed America's Cup winner Intrepid and was one of the first designers to use carbon fiber in the marine industry. Applying his incredible skills to the 30-30, he created an incredibly fast boat, particularly when compared to the other models of Allied, a company that made its name from overbuilt, ocean-going cruisers."
