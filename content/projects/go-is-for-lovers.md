## Introduction to Go Templates

Go templates provide an extremely simple template language. It adheres to the
belief that only the most basic of logic belongs in the template or view layer.
One consequence of this simplicity is that go templates parse very quickly.

A unique characteristic of go templates is they are content aware. Variables and
content will be sanitized depending on the context of where they are used. More
details can be found in the [go docs][gohtmltemplate].
